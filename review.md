1. Code formatting is must but differs and depends on language or type of file.
HTML type = "submit" should be type="submit"

2. Use css instead of style it saves time, duplication and possible effort when
requires modification

3. Avoid <br> should use padding, margin or style for span

4. Remove duplication if ($_POST['submit'] == 'add') / 'update / 'delete could be clubbed together

5. Correct formatting
} echo "</table>";

6. Name your file correctly employeeOperation => employee.php is fine
